# Homework 1 README

## Installation
- If you have a version of python with numpy and scipy, you can skip this step. Otherwise, you can install Poetry for Python dependency management at https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation, and then install required Python packages using Poetry:
    ```bash
    poetry install --no-root
    ```
- Ensure you have a C compiler (e.g., `gcc`) installed to compile the benchmarking harness.

- Build the C benchmarking harness by running `make` in the terminal.
